    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 91-92%[11] of humans worldwide are non-vegetarian in that they are neither ovo-lacto- vegetarians nor vegans, according to a 2018 survey by Ipsos Mori. 74% of the world's population "Regularly eat both animal and non-animal products", 14% "Only occasionally eat meat or fish", and 3% "Do not eat meat but do eat fish". Only 3% are vegan, i. e. eat no animal products at all.[6] The dietary categories in the survey do not map directly onto the Indian definitions of vegetarianism and nonvegetarianism. The number of nonvegetarians worldwide under the Indian definition (consumption of other animal products than cows milk, derived products, and honey) lies between 91 and 97%.[12]</p>
